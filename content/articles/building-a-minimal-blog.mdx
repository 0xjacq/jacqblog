Building a personal blog doesn't have to be complicated. In fact, the simpler the better. In this article, I'll walk through the key decisions and implementation details behind this very blog.

## Why Next.js + MDX?

The combination of Next.js and MDX offers several compelling benefits:

1. **Static Generation** — Pages are pre-rendered at build time for lightning-fast loading
2. **React Components in Markdown** — MDX lets you embed interactive React components
3. **File-based Content** — No database or CMS needed, just markdown files in your repo
4. **Excellent Developer Experience** — Hot reload, TypeScript support, and great tooling

## The Tech Stack

Here's what powers this blog:

- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **MDX** via `next-mdx-remote`
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vercel** for deployment

## Project Structure

The content lives in a `content/` directory with subdirectories for each content type:

```
content/
├── articles/
│   └── *.mdx
├── projects/
│   └── *.mdx
└── books/
    └── *.mdx
```

Each MDX file has frontmatter that defines metadata like title, date, and tags.

## Key Features

### Reading Time

The reading time is calculated using the `reading-time` package:

```typescript
import readingTime from 'reading-time';

const stats = readingTime(content);
// stats.text = "5 min read"
```

### RSS Feed

RSS is generated dynamically using a route handler at `/rss.xml`. This allows readers to subscribe to updates using their favorite RSS reader.

### Dark Mode

The blog uses a dark theme by default, with carefully chosen colors for readability:

- Background: `#0a0a0a`
- Text: `#e5e5e5`
- Accent: `#3b82f6`

## Conclusion

Building a minimal blog is a great exercise in restraint. Instead of adding every feature imaginable, focus on what matters: the content and the reading experience.
