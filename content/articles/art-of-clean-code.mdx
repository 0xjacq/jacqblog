Clean code is not just about making your code work — it's about making it understandable and maintainable for yourself and others.

## What Makes Code "Clean"?

Clean code has several characteristics:

1. **Readable** — Easy to understand at a glance
2. **Simple** — Does one thing well
3. **Testable** — Easy to verify correctness
4. **Maintainable** — Easy to modify without breaking things

## Naming Matters

Good names are perhaps the most important aspect of clean code. A well-named variable or function tells you what it does without needing comments.

```javascript
// Bad
const d = new Date();
const x = d.getTime();

// Good
const currentDate = new Date();
const timestamp = currentDate.getTime();
```

## Functions Should Be Small

A function should do one thing and do it well. If you find yourself writing a function that spans multiple screens, it's time to break it up.

> "The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that." — Robert C. Martin

## Avoid Premature Optimization

Don't optimize before you have evidence of a performance problem. Premature optimization often leads to:

- More complex code
- Harder to maintain systems
- Time wasted on non-issues

## Conclusion

Writing clean code is a skill that improves with practice. Start by being intentional about naming, keep functions small, and always prefer clarity over cleverness.

The best code is code that reads like prose.
