A practical guide to building good habits and breaking bad ones.

## The Main Idea

Small habits compound over time. Getting 1% better every day leads to remarkable results.

## The Four Laws of Behavior Change

### 1. Make It Obvious

Design your environment so the cues for good habits are visible and the cues for bad habits are hidden.

### 2. Make It Attractive

Bundle temptations. Pair actions you want to do with actions you need to do.

### 3. Make It Easy

Reduce friction for good habits. Prepare your environment in advance.

### 4. Make It Satisfying

Use immediate rewards. Track your habits visually.

## Practical Tips

- Use habit stacking: "After [current habit], I will [new habit]"
- Design your environment for success
- Never miss twice in a row

## What I Took Away

The concept of "habit stacking" has been particularly useful. I've attached new habits to existing ones, making them easier to remember.

## Rating

4/5 — Excellent practical advice, though some concepts could be more concise.
