Cal Newport makes a compelling case for focused, distraction-free work in an age of constant connectivity.

## The Core Idea

Deep work is professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration. It's becoming increasingly rare and increasingly valuable.

## Key Concepts

### The Deep Work Hypothesis

The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at the same time it's becoming increasingly valuable. Those who cultivate this skill will thrive.

### Attention Residue

When you switch from Task A to Task B, your attention doesn't immediately follow. Part of it stays stuck on the original task. This residue reduces your performance.

### Rhythmic Philosophy

Schedule deep work at the same time every day. The routine removes the need for willpower.

## How I Apply It

After reading this book, I:

1. Block 4 hours every morning for focused coding
2. Turn off notifications during deep work
3. Keep a "shutdown ritual" to end the workday

## Rating

5/5 — This book fundamentally changed how I structure my workday.
