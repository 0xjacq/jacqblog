A classic that every developer should read. This book has shaped how I think about software development.

## Key Takeaways

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous representation in the system. Duplication leads to maintenance nightmares.

### Tracer Bullets

Instead of building complete features, fire "tracer bullets" — minimal end-to-end implementations that prove the architecture works.

### Know Your Tools

Invest time in learning your tools deeply. A developer who knows their editor, debugger, and version control system intimately is far more productive.

### Be a Catalyst for Change

Sometimes the best way to get a big change approved is to start small. Show people what's possible, and they'll want more.

## Favorite Quotes

> "Care about your craft. Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?"

> "Think! About your work."

## Would I Recommend It?

Absolutely. This is one of those books I revisit every few years and always find something new.
