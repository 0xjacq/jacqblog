You turn a knob. The sound changes. But is it better?

That's audio compression in a nutshell. Hours spent adjusting parameters you don't really understand. Hoping something "sounds pro." Never knowing if you're improving things or making them worse.

I was tired of it. So I built a tool to change that.

## The Problem

We've all been there.

You open a compressor in your DAW. Four knobs: Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Release. You read a tutorial. "The threshold defines the level at which compression kicks in."

Ok. But what does that actually mean?

You turn the knob. The sound changes. Maybe. You're not sure. You read another tutorial. Same explanation, same words, same confusion.

The problem isn't that compression is complicated. The problem is we're trying to learn a *sonic* phenomenon with *words*.

It's like learning to swim by reading a book.

## The Idea

What if you could **see** what you hear?

The idea came to me while watching an oscilloscope for the first time. Suddenly, sound wasn't invisible anymore. I could observe the peaks, the valleys, the dynamics.

Why hadn't anyone done this for compression?

A tool where every parameter is visible in real time. Where you hear AND observe. Where you can experiment without risking breaking anything.

Not a tutorial. Not a video. A sound laboratory.

## What I Built

Promfressor is a free web application for learning audio compression.

You load your own music (or use the provided samples). You manipulate a real compressor. And you see exactly what's happening.

**A real-time transfer curve** — A graph showing the relationship between the input signal and the output signal. When you move the threshold, the curve changes. When you increase the ratio, the slope steepens. No more imagining: you see it.

**Before/after visualizations** — Two meters side by side. The original signal. The compressed signal. The level difference in real time.

**A progressive learning path** — 9 modules that take you from zero to creating your own presets.

## The 9 Modules

Each module focuses on a single concept. Just one.

1. **Diagnosis** — Analyze your music. Where are the dynamics issues?

2. **Threshold** — The trigger point. At what volume does compression start.

3. **Ratio** — The intensity. Gentle compression or total squashing?

4. **Attack** — Reaction speed. Keep the punch or smooth out the transients.

5. **Release** — The recovery. Short for groove. Long for natural sound.

6. **Knee & Makeup** — The finishing touches. Smooth transitions and volume compensation.

7. **Coloration** — The effect on timbre. Why some compressors "sound" different.

8. **Recipes** — Presets by genre. Funk, rock, pop. Listen, compare, understand.

9. **DAW Bridge** — Translate your settings to your usual software.

You only move to the next module when you've truly understood the previous one. No rushing. No overload.

## What It Changes

I built Promfressor for others. But I learned the most myself.

While creating the visualizations, I finally understood what "soft knee" really means. While programming the attack modules, I grasped why my compressions always sounded "flat."

The magic happens when you see the sound transform in real time. When your bass note peak hits the threshold and you watch the curve react. When you increase the attack and see the transients reappear.

It's no longer black magic. It's physics. Visible.

## Try It Yourself

Promfressor is free and runs directly in your browser. No installation. No account required.

Load an audio file. Play with the parameters. Watch. Listen.

In 20 minutes, you'll understand compression better than after hours of YouTube tutorials.

The project keeps evolving. More modules are coming. More instruments too.

But the best time to start learning is now.
