TaskFlow is a keyboard-first task management application designed for developers who want to stay in the flow.

## The Problem

Most task management apps are designed for the mouse. They have beautiful UIs with lots of clicking and dragging. But for developers who spend most of their time on the keyboard, this is inefficient.

## The Solution

TaskFlow is designed from the ground up for keyboard navigation:

- `j/k` to move between tasks
- `Enter` to edit
- `Space` to toggle complete
- `d` to delete
- `/` to search

## Features

- **Vim-like keybindings** — Navigate without touching the mouse
- **Markdown support** — Format task descriptions with markdown
- **Offline-first** — Works without internet, syncs when online
- **Dark mode** — Of course

## Technical Details

Built with:

- React 18 with TypeScript
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- IndexedDB for local storage
- Service workers for offline support

## What I Learned

Building TaskFlow taught me a lot about:

- Implementing keyboard navigation in React
- Building offline-first applications
- Designing for power users
